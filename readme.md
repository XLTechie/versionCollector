### Version Selector: An NVDA Add-on

**This add-on is in the alpha development stage. It's not expected to work fully, or be fully documented.**

This is an [NVDA](https://nvaccess.org/) add-on, designed to collect the name and version numbers of any software the user runs. This process is completely passive to the user. As long as the add-on is enabled, it will collect version info.

Currently, each time you restart NVDA, the collected data is lost. A file-backed listing is intended for a future version.

An additional potential feature, is the collection of NVDA add-ons and their versions.
